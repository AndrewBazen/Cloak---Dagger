## current update and status

Date: 05-24-2025

**Restructured Scripts**
The scripts have been fully restructured to enhance modularity and maintainability. Each script now has a clear purpose and can be easily modified or extended.

**GameManger.cs**
The GameManager has been updated to handle the state of the game and deal with in-game events and intercommunication between scripts. It serves as the central hub for managing game flow and interactions.
